  <!-- 

     Every angular application is contain at least on component which
     is known as root component.

     the name of root component is app.component.


     other component of the angular project are included into app.
     component directly or indirectly.

     but each and every belongs to an module.so app-component is belogn to the app.module

     app.module is root module of angular application.
